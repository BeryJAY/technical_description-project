<li>Purpose</li>
<p>The purpose of this software design documentation is to describe the architecture,
system design and the implementation of Biometric based car to driver matching 
security system for urban plots as described in the requirements document.</p>
<p> Biometric based car to 
driver matching security system for urban plots is designed to enhance car security in parking areas.</p>
<li>Scope</li> 
 <p>This document describes the architecture, system design and implementation of the driver to car matching security system. 
 The system matchesthe finger print details to the car number plate so that notification is sent in cases of theft. This will help in enhancing car security.</p>
<li>Overview</li>  
<p>In the introduction of the documentation, we describe the purpose of the Biometric based car to driver matching security 
system for urban plots as described in the system requirements specification. </p>
<p>The documentation provides the scope of this project explaining its goals, objectives and benefits in brief. The documentation also contains 
the reference materials which were used. </p>
<p>In addition, the document contains the system overview which gives the general description of the functionality, context and design of this project. </p>
<p>The architecture of the system that this project is going to come up with is also explained here. In the Architecture we find modular program
 structures showing the different relationships of the different modules in the system and how they work together to achieve the complete 
 functionality of the system.</p>
<p>There is a decomposition description providing the different subsystems in the architectural design.</p> 
 <p>The documentation further contains the data design showing the different data modules, component design to look at what each component does in 
 a more systematic way.</p>
<p> Lastly interface design describing the functionality of the system from the user’s perspective and also the Requirements 
 matrix to provide a cross reference that traces components and data structures to the requirements in the SRS document.</p>

<p>This system has a mobile application and a desktop application. 
The mobile application is used by the people who want to use the parking areas to park their cars and these are the drivers of the cars. 
The desktop application is used by the employees of the parking area to monitor the activities of the parking area.</p>

<p>The system enables user to see available parking. 
The activities that a user can perform while using this system include:
<li>Logging in</li> 
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Updating user details</li> 
<li>Viewing available parking areas</li> 
</p>

<header>Functions of the system</header>
<article>
<p>These are the functions of the system;</p>
<ol>
<li>The system shall be able to capture the biometric information of the car driver and the car number plate.</li>
<li>The system shall be able to match the car’s number plate to its driver’s fingerprint.</li>
<li>The system shall be able to display available parking areas.</li> 
<li>Notify the driver who brought in the car at entry about incase another person is taking the car out of the parking.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any person with a smart phone who regularly uses parking areas with the system deployed, 
as well as the parking operators stationed at the parking areas can use this application.</p> 
</article></section>

<section class="main-section" id="Architectural design">
<header>Architectural Design</header>
<article>
<p>The system follows a client-server architectural style that is divided into three parts, namely; 
<ol><li>Client in form of the mobile application that captures the user actions and a desktop application that is installed in the parking area.</li>
<li>Server in form of the Parking Management Server </li>
<li>Database layer, that consists of data repositories.</li> </ol></p>

<p>The main components of the system that collaborate to achieve the desired functionality include; 
<ul><li>Client:</li>This is the main user interface in form of mobile application that shows the number of available parking slots.
This happens as one is viewing the details of a parking area. Also displays the parking bill they are supposed to pay for a given interval.
it also shows the other parking benefits of using the parking area.
<li>Parking operator:</li>The person who is able to identify car thefts when the system detects mismatch of car 
and driver at exit point from the ones that were at car entry, keep watch of those who have not fulfilled payments. 
<li>Application logic (Parking Management Server):</li> It consists of several modules that are in charge of different responsibilities and these include; 
<ul><li>Registration module: It is responsible for registering the drivers and parking operators as well as authorizing access to the mobile application through use of login credentials.
<li>Matching module: It is responsible for matching the car to the driver’s thumbprint both on entry to and exit from the parking area.</li>
<li>Tallying module: This is the module that tallies the fingerprint of the driver and the number plate of the car.</li>
<li>Analysis module: This is the module that is responsible for the generation of the weekly reports to the manager.</li></ul></ul></p>
<p>Below is the architectural design of the sytem.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Design Rationale">
<header>Design Rationale</header>
<article>
<p>The system is based on the Three Tier client/server architectural style that depicts the 
client as the mobile application and server stub as the Parking Management server. </p>
<p>Reasons for choosing a three tier Client/Server architecture
 
<li>Heterogeneity: The 3-tier model can work best in a heterogeneous database environment where all the database servers and the interactions with 
these servers are of different types because the middleware server can be used for provision of data access connections to heterogeneous data 
sources as a database gateway.</li> 

<li>High performance: The middleware server provides high speed native access to multiple databases, so performance is improved over database connectivity 
solutions like Open Database Connectivity. That means one is not embedding SQL (Structured Query Language) programs into client applications and not locking one´s products to specific database vendors. </li>


<li>Easily change and maintain each domain without affecting others when the interface, application logic and data service are separated.</li>

<li>Implementing a 3-tier application using a database gateway as a middleware server can cause the application logic and business rules achieve database 
independence. This means that you can use different data sources without modification of the application logic and business rules.</li></p> 
<p>Tradeoffs :
 It increases complexity in building the middleware instead of focusing on the client and server only. </p>
